# ArkanoidGame---advanced

In this assignment we are back to working on the Arkanoid game.

We will be adding the following capabilities:

- Removing blocks when they are hit.
- "Killing" the player when all the balls fall of the screen.
- Keeping score.
- Keeping track of number of lives.
- balls change colors when they collide.
- a few additional features.
- In terms of object-oriented techniques, the main new technique we will be using is the Listener pattern (also called Observer). You can also use inheritance if you find use for it.

Finally, in this assignment we can create an executable jar file, that will contain our compiled code in a single file instead of spread out over many class files.
